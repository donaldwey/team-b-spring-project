All the data for this system will be stored in text files.\r\n\r\nThe application consists of five major screens: \r\n\r\n* Welcome and login screen - Welcomes the student and prompts them to create a username.\r\n* Catalog screen - Lists all the available courses\r\n* Schedule screen - Lists all the scheduled courses for a particular student\r\n* Register screen - Allows the student to register for a course\r\n* Un-register screen - Allows the student to un-register for a course\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
